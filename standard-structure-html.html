      <h1>Practing With HTML</h1>
      <p>The goal of this repository is to practice HTML without following along a tutorial or textbook. However, I do reference these resources to locate useful elements.</p>

      <h2>Why practice?</h2>
      <p>The reason for practice is because when we actually make an effort to do something from our own mind we learn more. If you wish to work in the professional world you need to actually <em>DO</em> the work if you want to really grow.</p>
      <h2>Running Into Problems or Information Lack</h2>
      <p>When you run into problems you have to solve them. When you solve them you learn more and gain a deeper understanding of the topic you are working on.</p>
      <h2>Working In Groups</h2>
      <p>When you work in a group with others when you run into an issue you can ask your peers. When you run into an issue or a topic you do not understand it is more likely that someone in your group will have the knowledge and can explain it in a way you understand.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Four people studying a topic together can be more effective then working alone. Especially in mathematics.</li>
        <li>We accomplish more when we collaborate. We can combine our various strengths and experiences to put things together.</li>
        <li>Humans are a social species. This is why we have cities, towns, and villages. When people come together we are more capable of manifesting wonderful things.</li>
